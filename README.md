## Hi there 👋

![Visitor count badge](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=ent3r) ![Followers badge](https://img.shields.io/github/followers/ent3r?label=Followers&style=flat)

My name is ent3r! I am a student in Norway, and I'm part of a CTF team called [Team Corax](https://corax.team). We are the 3rd best team in Norway!

I also do a lot of programming in my free time. I mostly program in node.js, HTML+CSS, JavaScript, and python. I also use frameworks every now and then. Mainly Vue.js.

I have also made a couple websites using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

### A couple cool things I've created:

- A repo with different python templates (flask, logging, tkinter, etc): [ent3r/Python-templates](https://github.com/ent3r/Python-templates)
- A "framework" for a discord bot made in node.js using discord.js: [ent3r/JADB](https://github.com/ent3r/JADB)
- A theme switcher made in HTML, CSS, and JS: [ent3r-s-projects/theme-switcher](https://github.com/ent3r-s-projects/theme-switcher)
- A discord RFC bot made in node.js that automatically responds with an RFC spec. if it detects it in a message: [ent3r-s-projects/discord-rfc-bot](https://github.com/ent3r-s-projects/discord-rfc-bot)

### Projects im working on and stuff (idk):

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an extensive project to make a login and auth page using:
  - OAuth2 and email+password authentication
  - MongoDB for storage
  - "Keep me logged in" system using JSON web tokens
  - Website made with Vue.js
  - Node.js and express for the backend

- 🌱 I’m currently (trying to) learn Vue.js to make the page mentioned above.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with making the MongoDB storage system to store passwords safely. Good luck contacting me though, I don't really have anywhere yet
